/**
 * Release notes for a template release, written for the people who will take it into a project.
 *
 * GitHub's generated notes list pull request titles, which say what changed in this repository. An
 * adopter needs something else: which files change in a project made from the template. So this
 * generates a project from every preset at both releases, with that release's own init, and compares
 * the two — what template-update.mjs does to build its patch. The notes then list what an update
 * actually applies, which a diff of the template tree cannot tell: a change inside a marker block
 * reaches only the presets that keep that block, and a file whose ownership moved is deleted from the
 * presets that no longer own it while its contents never changed at all.
 *
 *   node template/release-notes.mjs --to v1.4.1                 # since the previous release tag
 *   node template/release-notes.mjs --to v1.4.1 --from v1.3.0
 *
 * A file list says what changes, not what an adopter must do about it: which new check can turn their
 * build red, which file to merge by hand. So a minor or major release carries notes of its own,
 * template/notes/v<version>.md, written with the change, and they come first, under "What you need to
 * know". A test fails a patch-0 version without them (NOTES_DIR).
 *
 * Template-only: init deletes it, with the rest of template/.
