# Architecture decision records

Each record captures one decision that shapes this repository: the context that forced it, what was decided, the alternatives rejected, and what it costs. Start a new one from [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md) with the next free number.

Records are amended, not rewritten. When a decision changes, a new record supersedes the old one and the old one's status points to it, so the reasoning behind every past state stays readable.
