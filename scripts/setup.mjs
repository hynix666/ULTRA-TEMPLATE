/**
 * Installs the dependencies of every module present, with the command its toolchain declares in
 * TOOLCHAINS (scripts/modules.mjs): the one that installs exactly what the lockfile pins and refuses a
 * lockfile that no longer matches its manifest, or, for a module whose first lockfile is not written
 * yet, the one that writes it.
 *
 * npm installs run with --ignore-scripts: no dependency's install script runs on this machine, which
 * is how npm worms spread. The flag covers installation only; `npm run` and `npm pack` behave as usual.
 *
 *   node scripts/setup.mjs              # every module present
 *   node scripts/setup.mjs web          # only the modules named, as a module's CI job does
 *
 * Exit 0 all installed · 1 an install failed · 2 a module name that is not present, or a malformed manifest.
